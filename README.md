# Liquibase

Liquibase is a tool for managing database creation and maintenance scripts in a platform-independent, database-neutral way. It supports all the major DB platforms, and most of the minor ones, too. And you can always add support for more using extensions.

See the [Liquibase web site](http://www.liquibase.org/) for more details.
